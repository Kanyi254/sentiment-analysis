        "SentimentFlow aims to address a real-world problem related to understanding public sentiment towards Apple and Google products on Twitter. The stakeholders include companies, marketing teams, and decision-makers who want to gauge public opinion and make informed strategic decisions based on social media sentiment.\n",

        "### Problem Statement\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is to accurately classify the sentiment of tweets related to Apple and Google products. We want to determine whether a tweet expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This classification can help companies understand customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and tailor their responses accordingly.\n",

        "Main Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "> To develop a NLP (Natural Language Processing) multiclass classification model for sentiment analysis, aim to achieve a recall score of 80% and an accuracy of 80%. The model should categorize sentiments into three classes: Positive, Negative, and Neutral.\n",

        "The dataset originates from CrowdFlower via data.world. Contributors evaluated tweets related to various brands and products. Specifically:\n",
        "- Each tweet was labeled as expressing positive, negative, or no emotion toward a brand or product.\n",
        "- If emotion was expressed, contributors specified which brand or product was the target.\n",

        "### Suitability of Data\n",
        "Here's why this dataset is suitable for our project:\n",
        "1. **Relevance:** The data directly aligns with our business problem of understanding Twitter sentiment for Apple and Google products.\n",
        "2. **Real-World Context:** The tweets represent actual user opinions, making the problem relevant in practice.\n",
        "3. **Multiclass Labels:** We can build both binary (positive/negative) and multiclass (positive/negative/neutral) classifiers using this data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dataset Size\n",
        "The dataset contains over 9,000 labeled tweets. We'll explore its features to gain insights.\n",

        "### Descriptive Statistics\n",
        "- **tweet_text:** The content of each tweet.\n",

        "- **emotion_in_tweet_is_directed_at:** The brand or product mentioned in the tweet.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feature Inclusion\n",
        "Tweet text is the primary feature. The emotion label and target brand/product are essential for classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Limitations\n",
        "- **Label Noise:** Human raters' subjectivity may introduce noise.\n",
        "- **Imbalanced Classes:** We'll address class imbalance during modeling.\n",
        "- **Contextual Challenges:** Tweets are often short and context-dependent.\n",
        "- **Incomplete & Missing Data:** Could affect the overall performance of the models."
